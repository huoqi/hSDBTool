Java Tool for AWS SimpleDB use WindowBuilder

Thanks to SimpleDB Firefox Plugin (https://github.com/floodfx/sdbtool)

Several weeks ago I want to learn about AWS SimpleDB, but it doesn't have any UI. 

Then I found that plugin, but it has not updated for several years. It just has four or five regions.

I add all other regions for it and update some others.

Thanks to author very very much to give me the merge permission.

I write this java tool based on that.
